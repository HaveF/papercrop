* How to install.
{{{
sh ./ubuntu_installer.sh
}}}

This will install paperCrop at the current folder where ubuntu_installer.sh is.

* How to update to the latest version.

Just re-run the script
{{{
sh ./ubuntu_installer.sh
}}}
Update is usually much faster than first-install.

* The following error message appeared while updating:
{{{
Conflict discovered in 'paperCrop_source/config.lua'.
Select: (p) postpone, (df) diff-full, (e) edit,
        (mc) mine-conflict, (tc) theirs-conflict,
        (s) show all options: 
}}}
Type in
{{{
tf
}}}
This option (theirs-full) will discard your local modifications on config.lua, and get the latest version.

* Update doesn't seem to work. What should I do?

Reverting your modification of config.lua might be needed.
{{{
cd paperCrop_source
svn revert config.lua
}}}

Rebuilding the entire source code might be helpful.
{{{
cd paperCrop_source
sh clean_build.sh
}}}
